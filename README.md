- 👋 Hi, I'm @jboinembalome
- 👀 I'm a design and development engineer from France with a passion for application development. 
I'm particularly interested in C# (yes I know it's broad but I'm interested in everything 😃), Angular, Best Practices, Design patterns and Software Architectures
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any kind of interesting project that could help developers around the world 🙏
